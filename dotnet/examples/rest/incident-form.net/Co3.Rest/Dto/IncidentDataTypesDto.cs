    ///  This is a dynamic map that indicates which data types (e.g. Credit card number, SSN or SIN, etc.) that were lost as part of the incident.  The key portion of the map is the data type ID and the value portion is a true/false boolean indicating whether the data type was lost.  For example, the following JSON object indicates that the first name (id #19) and last name (id #20) were lost: { "19": true, "20": true }The list of possible data types (with their ID values) is available in the constDTO data_types property.
